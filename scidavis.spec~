Name: scidavis
Version: 1.14
Release: alt2

Summary: SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data analysis and publication-quality plotting. It combines a shallow learning curve and an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful features such as scriptability and extensibility. SciDAVis runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS X; possibly also on other platforms like *BSD, although this is untested.

%description
SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data
analysis and publication-quality plotting. It combines a
shallow learning curve and an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical
user interface with powerful features such as scriptability and
extensibility. SciDAVis runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS X;
possibly also on other platforms like *BSD, although this
is untested.

SciDAVis is similar in its field of application to proprietary Windows
applications like Origin and SigmaPlot as well as free applications
like QtiPlot, Labplot and Gnuplot.

What sets SciDAVis apart from the above is its emphasis on providing
a friendly and open environment (in the software as well as the
project) for new and experienced users alike. Particularly, this
means that we will try to provide good documentation on all levels,
ranging from users manual over tutorials down to and including
documentation of the internal APIs We encourage users to share
their experiences on our forums and on our mailing lists.
